<h3> <i><ins>A. Agent:</ins></i> It can be a human or a computer, is the performer. An agent is just something that acts. In terms of computer: Computer operate autonomously, perceive their environment, persist over a prolonged period, adapt to change, and create and pursue goals. A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best outcome. .</h3>


<h3> <i><ins>B.Algorithm:</ins></i> An algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous for solving a problem, i.e., for obtaining a required output for any legitimate input in a finite amount of time. Algorithm refers to the steps to be carried out in order to accomplish a particular task .</h3>


<h3> Three things to be considered while writing algorithm:<i><ins>Input</ins></i>, <i><ins>process</ins></i>, and <i><ins>output</ins></i>.The input that we give to an algorithm is processed with the of the procedure and finally returns the output. </h3>

<h1> 3. Ways of Writing an Algorithm</h1>
<ul>
<h3> There are various ways of writing an algorithm. </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h3> 1.<ins>English-Like Algorithm</ins></h3></li> 
        <ul>
            <h3><i><ins>Eg:</ins></i></h3>
            
```Syntax

Algorithm : English – like algorithm of linear search.
	
Step 1: Compare `item` with the first element of the array, A.
Step 2: If the two are same, then print the position of the element and exit.
Step 3: Else repeat the above process with the rest of the elements.
Step 4: If the item is not found at any position, then print ‘not found’ and exit.

```

<h3> Disadvantage:</h3>
<ul>
<li><h3> 1.Natural Languages can be ambiguous and therefore its lack the characteristics of being definite.</h3></li> 
<li><h3> 2.English language-like algorithms are not considered good for most of the task.</h3></li> 
</ul>

<li><h3> 2.<ins>Flow Chart</ins></h3></li> 
<ul>
<h3> Flowcharts pictorially depict a process. They are easy to understand and are commonly used in the case of simple problems.</h3> 
</ul>
<li><h3> 3.<ins>Pseudo-code.</ins></h3></li> 
<ul>
<h3>An artificial and informal language constituting of notations helps in resembling a simplified programming language, used in program design. This way of writing algorithm is most acceptable and most widely used.</h3>
