<h3> <i><ins>A. Agent:</ins></i> It can be a human or a computer, is the performer. An agent is just something that acts. In terms of computer: Computer operate autonomously, perceive their environment, persist over a prolonged period, adapt to change, and create and pursue goals. A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best outcome. .</h3>


<h3> <i><ins>B.Algorithm:</ins></i> An algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous for solving a problem, i.e., for obtaining a required output for any legitimate input in a finite amount of time. Algorithm refers to the steps to be carried out in order to accomplish a particular task .</h3>


<h3> Three things to be considered while writing algorithm:<i><ins>Input</ins></i>, <i><ins>process</ins></i>, and <i><ins>output</ins></i>.The input that we give to an algorithm is processed with the of the procedure and finally returns the output. </h3>
